However, there are various challenges in delivering and interpreting the biofeedback information, which prevents an optimal experience. Therefore, this study presents the fundamentals of developing a real-time HRV biofeedback system using deep breathing exercise by exploring the minimum time window of RR-intervals resulting in a reliable analysis. Moreover, it investigates the appropriate HRV measures by examining the significant changes between resting and breathing conditions and the trends consistency across ultra-short-term segments. The overall results suggest that a minimum time window of 20-seconds can provide a reliable HRV time-domain analysis. Whereas the possible HRV measures that can be used in a real-time biofeedback system are SDNN, LF, and total power. These outcomes will contribute to the design of a self-monitoring HRV biofeedback system based on a multi-modal approach.},

   abstract = {Identifying bio-signals based-sleep stages requires time-consuming and tedious labor of skilled clinicians. Deep learning approaches have been introduced in order to challenge the automatic sleep stage classification conundrum. However, the difficulties can be posed in replacing the clinicians with the automatic system due to the differences in many aspects found in individual bio-signals, causing the inconsistency in the performance of the model on every incoming individual. Thus, we aim to explore the feasibility of using a novel approach, capable of assisting the clinicians and lessening the workload. We propose the transfer learning framework, entitled MetaSleepLearner, based on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to transfer the acquired sleep staging knowledge from a large dataset to new individual subjects. The framework was demonstrated to require the labelling of only a few sleep epochs by the clinicians and allow the remainder to be handled by the system. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was also applied to understand the learning course of our approach. In all acquired datasets, in comparison to the conventional approach, MetaSleepLearner achieved a range of 5.4% to 17.7% improvement with statistical difference in the mean of both approaches. The illustration of the model interpretation after the adaptation to each subject also confirmed that the performance was directed towards reasonable learning. MetaSleepLearner outperformed the conventional approaches as a result from the fine-tuning using the recordings of both healthy subjects and patients. This is the first work that investigated a non-conventional pre-training method, MAML, resulting in a possibility for human-machine collaboration in sleep stage classification and easing the burden of the clinicians in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs rather than an entire recording.},

We combined behavioural manipulation and modelling to investigate the dynamics of memory formation for rarely reoccurring acoustic patterns. In a series of experiments, participants detected the emergence of regularly repeating patterns within rapid tone-pip sequences. Unbeknownst to them, a few patterns reoccurred every ~3 minutes. All sequences consisted of the same 20 frequencies and were distinguishable only by the order of tone-pips. Despite this, reoccurring patterns were associated with a rapidly growing detection-time advantage over novel patterns. This effect was implicit, robust to interference, and persisted up to 7 weeks. The results implicate an interplay between short (a few seconds) and long-term (over many minutes) integration in memory formation and demonstrate the remarkable sensitivity of the human auditory system to sporadically reoccurring structure within the acoustic environment.},

The 2017 edition focused on replay spoofing attacks, and involved participants building and training systems on a provided dataset (ASVspoof 2017). More than 60 research papers have so far been published with this dataset, but none have sought to answer why countermeasures appear successful in detecting spoofing attacks. This article shows how artefacts inherent to the dataset may be contributing to the apparent success of published systems. We first inspect the ASVspoof 2017 dataset and summarize various artefacts present in the dataset. Second, we demonstrate how countermeasure models can exploit these artefacts to appear successful in this dataset. Third, for reliable and robust performance estimates on this dataset we propose discarding nonspeech segments and silence before and after the speech utterance during training and inference. We create speech start and endpoint annotations in the dataset and demonstrate how using them helps countermeasure models become less vulnerable from being manipulated using artefacts found in the dataset. Finally, we provide several new benchmark results for both frame-level and utterance-level models that can serve as new baselines on this dataset.},

While deep models are trained on the fullband spectrum of the signal, we argue that not all frequency bands are useful for these tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of different subbands and their importance on replay spoofing detection on two benchmark datasets: ASVspoof 2017 v2.0 and ASVspoof 2019 PA. We propose a joint subband modelling framework that employs n different sub-networks to learn subband specific features. These are later combined and passed to a classifier and the whole network weights are updated during training. Our findings on the ASVspoof 2017 dataset suggest that the most discriminative information appears to be in the first and the last 1 kHz frequency bands, and the joint model trained on these two subbands shows the best performance outperforming the baselines by a large margin. However, these findings do not generalise on the ASVspoof 2019 PA dataset. This suggests that the datasets available for training these models do not reflect real world replay conditions suggesting a need for careful design of datasets for training replay spoofing countermeasures.},

   abstract = {Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are highly vulnerable to presentation attacks, also called spoofing attacks. Replay is among the simplest attacks to mount - yet difficult to detect reliably. The generalization failure of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) has driven the community to study various alternative deep learning CMs. The majority of them are supervised approaches that learn a human-spoof discriminator. In this paper, we advocate a different, deep generative approach that leverages from powerful unsupervised manifold learning in classification. The potential benefits include the possibility to sample new data, and to obtain insights to the latent features of genuine and spoofed speech. To this end, we propose to use variational autoencoders (VAEs) as an alternative backend for replay attack detection, via three alternative models that differ in their class-conditioning. The first one, similar to the use of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in spoof detection, is to train independently two VAEs - one for each class. The second one is to train a single conditional model (C-VAE) by injecting a one-hot class label vector to the encoder and decoder networks. Our final proposal integrates an auxiliary classifier to guide the learning of the latent space. Our experimental results using constant-Q cepstral coefficient (CQCC) features on the ASVspoof 2017 and 2019 physical access subtask datasets indicate that the C-VAE offers substantial improvement in comparison to training two separate VAEs for each class. On the 2019 dataset, the C-VAE outperforms the VAE and the baseline GMM by an absolute 9-10% in both equal error rate (EER) and tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) metrics. Finally, we propose VAE residuals — the absolute difference of the original input and the reconstruction as features for spoofing detection. The proposed frontend approach augmented with a convolutional neural network classifier demonstrated substantial improvement over the VAE backend use case.},

   abstract = {We present a novel set of 200 Western tonal musical stimuli (MUST) to be used in research on perception and appreciation of music. It consists of four subsets of 50 stimuli varying in balance, contour, symmetry, or complexity. All are 4 s long and designed to be musically appealing and experimentally controlled. We assessed them behaviorally and computationally. The behavioral assessment (Study 1) aimed to determine whether musically untrained participants could identify variations in each attribute. Forty-three participants rated the stimuli in each subset on the corresponding attribute. We found that inter-rater reliability was high and that the ratings mirrored the design features well. Participants' ratings also served to create an abridged set of 24 stimuli per subset. The computational assessment (Study 2) required the development of a specific battery of computational measures describing the structural properties of each stimulus. We distilled nonredundant composite measures for each attribute and examined whether they predicted participants' ratings. Our results show that the composite measures indeed predicted participants' ratings. Moreover, the composite complexity measure predicted complexity ratings as well as existing models of musical complexity. We conclude that the four subsets are suitable for use in studies that require presenting participants with short musical motifs varying in balance, contour, symmetry, or complexity, and that the stimuli and the computational measures are valuable resources for research in music psychology, empirical aesthetics, music information retrieval, and musicology. The MUST set and MATLAB toolbox codifying the computational measures are freely available at osf.io/bfxz7.},

A prominent computational model of these processes is Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), a variable-order Markov model that learns by internalizing n-grams from training sequences. However, PPM has limitations as a cognitive model: in particular, it has a perfect memory that weights all historic observations equally, which is inconsistent with memory capacity constraints and recency effects observed in human cognition. We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies—one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment—we show how this decay kernel improves the model’s predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection.

This paper presents a new design of the real-time operating system (OS) scheduling mechanism called ‘time deterministic cyclic scheduling’ (TDCS) mainly for live multimedia tasks processing. This new scheduler shares a similar philosophy as classic cyclic execution but with flexibility and dynamic configuration. This hybrid design is based on both time-reserved based cyclic execution and priority-based pre-emptive scheduling for mixed criticality applications. The simulation results show that this scheduling scheme can achieve predictable timing behaviour of task delay and jitter under high CPU utilisation. This shows that the proposed scheme is promising for low latency high-performance multimedia censoring tasks that occur in a periodic manner.},

   abstract = {We report on the outcomes of a hackathon organised around the themes of absurd musical interfaces, questionable sonic interactions and unworkable music designs. At the core of the project is the intention to explore absurd making as a way to support critical and disruptive design practices. We reflect on how surreal, nonsensical and fragile artefacts can be helpful to stretch and critique conventional ideas of what is useful and appropriate in technology research and development. After introducing both concepts and methods that shaped the event we present a selection of useless interfaces designed by the hackathon's attendees. These musical artefacts, and the considerations around them, are then discussed as a viable means for communicating both design concerns and future visions. We also consider two features identified as playing a crucial role within the event: the discovery of contradictions and the importance of context-based ingredients.},

Currently, they are often used in music production for aesthetic reasons due to their particular sonic characteristics.

Based on digital reverberators that use sparse FIR filters, we propose a signal processing-informed deep learning architecture for the modeling of artificial reverberators. We explore the capabilities of deep neural networks to learn such highly nonlinear electromechanical responses and we perform modeling of plate and spring reverberators.

   abstract = {Virtual analog modeling of audio effects consists of emulating the sound of an audio processor reference device. This digital simulation is normally done by designing mathematical models of these systems. It is often difficult because it seeks to accurately model all components within the effect unit, which usually contains various nonlinearities and time-varying components. Most existing methods for audio effects modeling are either simplified or optimized to a very specific circuit or type of audio effect and cannot be efficiently translated to other types of audio effects. Recently, deep neural networks have been explored as black-box modeling strategies to solve this task, i.e., by using only input–output measurements. We analyse different state-of-the-art deep learning models based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks, feedforward WaveNet architectures and we also introduce a new model based on the combination of the aforementioned models. Through objective perceptual-based metrics and subjective listening tests we explore the performance of these models when modeling various analog audio effects. Thus, we show virtual analog models of nonlinear effects, such as a tube preamplifier; nonlinear effects with memory, such as a transistor-based limiter and nonlinear time-varying effects, such as the rotating horn and rotating woofer of a Leslie speaker cabinet.},

Sensitivity analysis, which involves analysing the effect of input perturbations on model predictions, is one of the methods to generate local explanations. Meaningful input perturbations are essential for generating reliable explanations, but there exists limited work on what such perturbations are and how to perform them. This work investigates these questions in the context of machine listening models that analyse audio. Specifically, we use a state-of-the-art deep singing voice detection (SVD) model to analyse whether explanations from SoundLIME (a local explanation method) are sensitive to how the method perturbs model inputs. The results demonstrate that SoundLIME explanations are sensitive to the content in the occluded input regions. We further propose and demonstrate a novel method for quantitatively identifying suitable content type(s) for reliably occluding inputs of machine listening models. The results for the SVD model suggest that the average magnitude of input mel-spectrogram bins is the most suitable content type for temporal explanations.},

By contrast, subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments. First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.},

We extend the proposed idea with a multi-head self attention mechanism where each attention head processes the audio embedding with explicit attention width values. The proposed use of memory controlled sequential self attention offers a way to induce relations among frames of sound event tokens. We show that our memory controlled self attention model achieves an event based F -score of 33.92% on the URBAN-SED dataset, outperforming the F -score of 20.10% reported by the model without self attention.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite recent significant progress in the development of automatic sleep staging methods, building a good model still remains a big challenge for sleep studies with a small cohort due to the data-variability and data-inefficiency issues. This work presents a deep transfer learning approach to overcome these issues and enable transferring knowledge from a large dataset to a small cohort for automatic sleep staging. METHODS: We start from a generic end-to-end deep learning framework for sequence-to-sequence sleep staging and derive two networks as the means for transfer learning. The networks are first trained in the source domain (i.e. the large database). The pretrained networks are then finetuned in the target domain (i.e. the small cohort) to complete knowledge transfer. We employ the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) database consisting of 200 subjects as the source domain and study deep transfer learning on three different target domains: the Sleep Cassette subset and the Sleep Telemetry subset of the Sleep-EDF Expanded database, and the Surrey-cEEGrid database. The target domains are purposely adopted to cover different degrees of data mismatch to the source domains. RESULTS: Our experimental results show significant performance improvement on automatic sleep staging on the target domains achieved with the proposed deep transfer learning approach. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the efficacy of the proposed approach in addressing the above-mentioned data-variability and data-inefficiency issues. SIGNIFICANCE: As a consequence, it would enable one to improve the quality of automatic sleep staging models when the amount of data is relatively small.},

Closely linked to statistical learning is the ability to form expectations about future events. Whether children as young as 5 years can make use of such internalized regularities to form expectations about the next note in a melody is still unclear. The possible effect of the home musical environment on the strength of musical expectations has also been under-explored. Using a newly developed melodic priming task that included melodies with either “expected” or “unexpected” endings according to rules of Western music theory, we tested 5- and 6-year-old children (N = 46). The stimuli in this task were constructed using the information dynamics of music (IDyOM) system, a probabilistic model estimating the level of “unexpectedness” of a note given the preceding context. Results showed that responses to expected versus unexpected tones were faster and more accurate, indicating that children have already formed robust melodic expectations at 5 years of age. Aspects of the home musical environment significantly predicted the strength of melodic expectations, suggesting that implicit musical learning may be influenced by the quantity of informal exposure to the surrounding musical environment.},

   abstract = {© 2020 The Author(s) Neural responses to auditory surprise are typically studied with highly unexpected, disruptive sounds. Consequently, little is known about auditory prediction in everyday contexts that are characterized by fine-grained, non-disruptive fluctuations of auditory surprise. To address this issue, we used IDyOM, a computational model of auditory expectation, to obtain continuous surprise estimates for a set of newly composed melodies. Our main goal was to assess whether the neural correlates of non-disruptive surprising sounds in a musical context are affected by musical expertise. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), auditory responses were recorded from musicians and non-musicians while they listened to the melodies. Consistent with a previous study, the amplitude of the N1m component increased with higher levels of computationally estimated surprise. This effect, however, was not different between the two groups. Further analyses offered an explanation for this finding: Pitch interval size itself, rather than probabilistic prediction, was responsible for the modulation of the N1m, thus pointing to low-level sensory adaptation as the underlying mechanism. In turn, the formation of auditory regularities and proper probabilistic prediction were reflected in later components: The mismatch negativity (MMNm) and the P3am, respectively. Overall, our findings reveal a hierarchy of expectations in the auditory system and highlight the need to properly account for sensory adaptation in research addressing statistical learning.},

   abstract = {Abstract Auditory prediction error responses elicited by surprising sounds can be reliably recorded with musical stimuli that are more complex and realistic than those typically employed in EEG or MEG oddball paradigms. However, these responses are reduced as the predictive uncertainty of the stimuli increases. In this study, we investigate whether this effect is modulated by musical expertise. Magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) responses were recorded from 26 musicians and 24 non-musicians while they listened to low-and high-uncertainty melodic sequences in a musical multi-feature paradigm that included pitch, slide, intensity, and timbre deviants. When compared to non-musicians, musically trained participants had significantly larger pitch and slide MMNm responses. However, both groups showed comparable reductions of pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-uncertainty condition compared to the low-uncertainty condition. In a separate, behavioral deviance detection experiment, musicians were more accurate and confident about their responses than non-musicians, but deviance detection in both groups was similarly affected by the uncertainty of the melodies. In both experiments, the interaction between uncertainty and expertise was not significant, suggesting that the effect is comparable in both groups. Consequently, our results replicate the modulatory effect of predictive uncertainty on prediction error; show that it is present across different types of listeners; and suggest that expertise-related and stimulus-driven modulations of predictive precision are dissociable and independent.},

Given the online availability of archival recordings, we propose to develop a real-world audio quality dataset. We present a methodology used to curate a speech quality database using the archive recordings from the Apollo Space Program. The proposed procedure is based on two steps: a pilot listening test and an exploratory data analysis. The pilot listening test shows that we can extract audio clips through the control of speech-to-text performance metrics to prevent data repetition. Through unsupervised exploratory data analysis, we explore the characteristics of the degradations. We classify distinct degradations and we study spectral, intensity, tonality and overall quality properties of the data through clustering techniques. These results provide the necessary foundation to support the subsequent development of large-scale crowdsourced datasets for audio quality.},

Recently, significant performance improvement has been obtained thanks to the usage of advanced deep learning models. However, feature robustness is still an unresolved issue and it is one of the main reasons why we need powerful deep learning architectures. In the presence of a variety of musical styles, hand-crafted features are less efficient in capturing audio degradation characteristics and they are prone to failure when recognising audio impairments and could mistakenly learn musical concepts rather than impairment types. In this paper, we propose a new representation of hand-crafted features that is based on the correlation of feature pairs. We experimentally compare the proposed correlation-based feature representation with a typical raw feature representation used in machine learning and we show superior performance in terms of compact feature dimensionality and improved computational speed in the test stage whilst achieving comparable accuracy.},

   abstract = {© 2020 ISCA This paper is a submission to the Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS) challenge, which aims to develop methods that can assist in the automated prediction of severity of Alzheimer's Disease from speech data. We focus on acoustic and natural language features for cognitive impairment detection in spontaneous speech in the context of Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score prediction. We proposed a model that obtains unimodal decisions from different LSTMs, one for each modality of text and audio, and then combines them using a gating mechanism for the final prediction. We focused on sequential modelling of text and audio and investigated whether the disfluencies present in individuals' speech relate to the extent of their cognitive impairment. Our results show that the proposed classification and regression schemes obtain very promising results on both development and test sets. This suggests Alzheimer's Disease can be detected successfully with sequence modeling of the speech data of medical sessions.},

As a source of ubiquitous data, smart city initiatives present opportunities to enhance inhabitants' urban awareness. However, making sense of smart city data is challenging and there is a gap between available data and end-user applications. Sonification emerges as a promising method for the interpretation of smart city data and the production of novel musical experiences. In this paper, we first present the smart city paradigm. We then cover the topics of ubiquitous and mobile music, followed by an overview of sonification research. Finally, we propose an approach entitled ubiquitous sonification and present the initial design of a speculative use case for musical smart city systems, leveraging user and urban data to inform behaviour.},

The transcribed copy should allow musicians to compose, play and edit music by taking a picture of a music sheet. Complete transcription of sheet music would also enable more efficient archival. OMR facilitates examining sheet music statistically or searching for patterns of notations, thus helping use cases in digital musicology too. Recently, there has been a shift in OMR from using conventional computer vision techniques towards a deep learning approach. In this paper, we review relevant works in OMR, including fundamental methods and significant outcomes, and highlight different stages of the OMR pipeline. These stages often lack standard input and output representation and standardised evaluation. Therefore, comparing different approaches and evaluating the impact of different processing methods can become rather complex. This paper provides recommendations for future work, addressing some of the highlighted issues and represents a position in furthering this important field of research.},

While their receptive field grows exponentially with the number of layers, computing the convolutions over very long sequences of features in each layer is time and memory-intensive, and prohibits the use of longer receptive fields in practice. To increase efficiency, we make use of the “slow feature” hypothesis stating that many features of interest are slowly varying over time. For this, we use a U-Net architecture that computes features at multiple time-scales and adapt it to our auto-regressive scenario by making convolutions causal. We apply our model (“Seq-U-Net”) to a variety of tasks including language and audio generation. In comparison to TCN and Wavenet, our network consistently saves memory and computation time, with speed-ups for training and inference of over 4x in the audio generation experiment in particular, while achieving a comparable performance on real-world tasks.},

However, official and public sources have notable deficiencies: spatial imprecision, gaps in coverage and lack of crucial meta data, especially for small-scale solar panel installations. We present the results of a major crowd-sourcing campaign to create open geographic data for over 260,000 solar PV installations across the UK, covering an estimated 86% of the capacity in the country. We focus in particular on capturing small-scale domestic solar PV, which accounts for a significant fraction of generation but was until now very poorly documented. Our dataset suggests nameplate capacities in the UK (as of September 2020) amount to a total of 10.66 GW explicitly mapped, or 13.93 GW when missing capacities are inferred. Our method is applied to the UK but applicable worldwide, and compatible with continual updating to track the rapid growth in PV deployment.},

   abstract = {Continuous exposure to urban noise has been found to be one of the major threats to citizens’ health. In this regard, several organizations are devoting huge efforts to designing new in-field systems to identify the acoustic sources of these threats to protect those citizens at risk. Typically, these prototype systems are composed of expensive components that limit their large-scale deployment and thus reduce the scope of their measurements. This paper aims to present a highly scalable low-cost distributed infrastructure that features a ubiquitous acoustic sensor network to monitor urban sounds. It takes advantage of (1) low-cost microphones deployed in a redundant topology to improve their individual performance when identifying the sound source, (2) a deep-learning algorithm for sound recognition, (3) a distributed data-processing middleware to reach consensus on the sound identification, and (4) a custom planar antenna with an almost isotropic radiation pattern for the proper node communication. This enables practitioners to acoustically populate urban spaces and provide a reliable view of noises occurring in real time. The city of Barcelona (Spain) and the UrbanSound8K dataset have been selected to analytically validate the proposed approach. Results obtained in laboratory tests endorse the feasibility of this proposal.},

The jTFST represents spectro-temporal patterns in the time–frequency domain, capturing discriminative information of PETs. As a case study, we analyse three commonly used PETs of the Chinese bamboo flute: acciacatura, portamento, and glissando, and encode their characteristics using the jTFST. To verify the proposed approach, we create a new dataset, the CBF-petsDB, containing PETs played in isolation as well as in the context of whole pieces performed and annotated by professional players. Feeding the jTFST to a machine learning classifier, we obtain F-measures of 71% for acciacatura, 59% for portamento, and 83% for glissando detection, and provide explanatory visualisations of scattering coefficients for each technique.},

The tempo, melody, and timbral features of the generated music are modulated according to biosensor input from each runner using a combination of PPG (Photoplethysmography) and GPS (Global Positioning System) from a wearable sensor, synchronized via Bluetooth. We compare the relative performance of athletes listening to music with heartrate and cadence synchronous tempos, across a randomized trial (N = 54) on a trail course with 76 ft of elevation. Participants were instructed to continue until their self-reported perceived effort went beyond an 18 using the Borg rating of perceived exertion. We found that cadence-synchronous music improved performance and decreased perceived effort in male runners. For female runners, cadence synchronous music improved performance but it was heartrate synchronous music which significantly reduced perceived effort and allowed them to run the longest of all groups tested.

In this paper, we investigate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for polyphonic music prediction, in the form of binary piano rolls. A preliminary experiment, assessing the influence of the timestep of piano rolls on system performance, highlights the need for more musical evaluation metrics. We introduce a range of metrics, focusing on temporal and harmonic aspects. We propose to combine them into a parametrisable loss to train our network. We then conduct a range of experiments with this new loss, both for polyphonic music prediction (intrinsic evaluation) and using our predictive model as a language model for AMT (extrinsic evaluation). Intrinsic evaluation shows that tuning the behaviour of a model is possible by adjusting loss parameters, with consistent results across timesteps. Extrinsic evaluation shows consistent behaviour across timesteps in terms of precision and recall with respect to the loss parameters, leading to an improvement in AMT performance without changing the complexity of the model. In particular, we show that intrinsic performance (in terms of cross entropy) is not related to extrinsic performance, highlighting the importance of using custom training losses for each specific application. Our model also compares favourably with previously proposed MLMs.},

Yet, some errors (e.g. out-of-key notes) are more salient than others. In this study, we design an online listening test to gather judgements about AMT quality. These judgements take the form of pairwise comparisons of transcriptions of the same music by pairs of different AMT systems. We investigate how these judgements correlate with benchmark metrics, and find that although they match in many cases, agreement drops when comparing pairs with similar scores, or pairs of poor transcriptions. We show that onset-only notewise F-measure is the benchmark metric that correlates best with human judgement, all the more so with higher onset tolerance thresholds. We define a set of features related to various musical attributes, and use them to design a new metric that correlates significantly better with listeners' quality judgements. We examine which musical aspects were important to raters by conducting an ablation study on the defined metric, highlighting the importance of the rhythmic dimension (tempo, meter).

   abstract = {The emotional use of music plays an important role in influencing people’s music-searching behaviour. Many users listen to music for multiple mood regulation purposes. Therefore, emotional preference should be taken into consideration especially when building context-aware music recommendation systems which aim to satisfy users’ short-term music needs. In addition, cultural differences will affect the way people experience and value emotion from music. Based on these aspects, we investigate the emotional preference of music in daily activities through a cross-cultural survey in China and the UK, and build emotional maps between activity and music for the two countries. Furthermore, we introduce EmoMusic, a novel emotion-based music recommendation service for daily activities which supports visualisation and control of music emotion through an interactive interface. A user study is presented to evaluate the application. Results reveal good usability of the service and show that visualization and interaction in a music emotion space can improve acceptance of music recommendations. Our work helps to understand the emotional preference of music for various activities and how to exploit emotional cues of music in a music recommendation service, paving the way for more user-centered music recommendation systems.},

   abstract = {The same piece of music can be performed in various styles by different performers. Vibrato plays an important role in violin players' emotional expression, and it is an important factor of playing style while execution shows great diversity. Expressive timing is also an important factor to reflect individual play styles. In our study, we construct a novel dataset, which contains 15 concertos performed by 9 master violinists. Four vibrato features and one timing feature are extracted from the data, and we present a method based on the similarity of feature distribution to identify violinists using each feature alone and fusion of features. The result shows that vibrato features are helpful for the identification, but the timing feature performs better, yielding a precision of 0.751. In addition, although the accuracy obtained from fused features are lower than using timing alone, discrimination for each performer is improved.},

   abstract = {© 2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is still a matter of debate whether visual aids improve learning of music. In a multisession study, we investigated the neural signatures of novel music sequence learning with or without aids (auditory-only: AO, audiovisual: AV). During three training sessions on three separate days, participants (nonmu-sicians) reproduced (note by note on a keyboard) melodic sequences generated by an artificial musical grammar. The AV group (n = 20) had each note color-coded on screen, whereas the AO group (n = 20) had no color indication. We evaluated learning of the statistical regularities of the novel music grammar before and after training by presenting melodies ending on correct or incorrect notes and by asking participants to judge the correctness and surprisal of the final note, while EEG was recorded. We found that participants successfully learned the new grammar. Although the AV group, as compared to the AO group, reproduced longer sequences during training, there was no significant difference in learning between groups. At the neural level, after training, the AO group showed a larger N100 response to low-probability compared with high-probability notes, suggesting an increased neural sensitivity to statistical properties of the grammar; this effect was not observed in the AV group. Our findings indicate that visual aids might improve sequence reproduction while not necessarily promoting better learning, indicating a potential dissociation between sequence reproduction and learning. We suggest that the difficulty induced by auditory-only input during music training might enhance cognitive engagement, thereby improving neural sensitivity to the underlying statistical properties of the learned material.},
