The second edition of the challenge on detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events (DCASE 2016) has offered such an opportunity for development of the state-of-the-art methods, and succeeded in drawing together a large number of participants from academic and industrial backgrounds. In this paper, we report on the tasks and outcomes of the DCASE 2016 challenge. The challenge comprised four tasks: acoustic scene classification, sound event detection in synthetic audio, sound event detection in real-life audio, and domestic audio tagging. We present each task in detail and analyze the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks. The datasets created for and used in DCASE 2016 are publicly available and are a valuable resource for further research.},

Five student sound engineers from the Paris Conservatoire mixed the multitrack source of two pop songs and fully documented their mixing process. The resulting mixes were then used as stimuli for a blind, multi-stimulus listening test in a high-quality listening room, that 13 students and one faculty member commented on and rated in terms of preference.

Analysing expressive timing in performed music can help machine to perform various perceptual tasks such as identifying performers and understand music structures in classical music. A hierarchical structure is commonly used for expressive timing analysis. This paper provides a statistical demonstration to support the use of hierarchical structure in expressive timing analysis by presenting two groups of model selection tests. The first model selection test uses expressive timing to determine the location of music structure boundaries. The second model selection test is matching a piece of performance with the same performer playing another given piece. Comparing the results of model selection tests, the preferred hierarchical structures in these two model selection tests are not the same. While determining music structure boundaries demands a hierarchical structure with more levels in the expressive timing analysis, a hierarchical structure with less levels helps identifying the dedicated performer in most cases.},

Probabilistic latent variable analysis can be particularly insightful, but existing approaches don’t incorporate prior knowledge about the physical behaviour of amplitude envelopes, such as exponential decay or feedback. We use latent force modelling, a probabilistic learning paradigm that encodes physical knowledge into Gaussian process regression, to model correlation across spectral subband envelopes. We augment the standard latent force model approach by explicitly modelling dependencies across multiple time steps. Incorporating this prior knowledge strengthens the interpretation of the latent functions as the source that generated the signal. We examine this interpretation via an experiment showing that sounds generated by sampling from our probabilistic model are perceived to be more realistic than those generated by comparative models based on nonnegative matrix factorisation, even in cases where our model is outperformed from a reconstruction error perspective.},

The Channel Strip mixer found on physical mixing desks is the primary Graphical User Interface design for most Digital Audio Workstations. While this metaphor provides transferable knowledge from hardware, there may be a risk that it does not always translate well into screen-based mixers. For example, the need to search through several windows of mix information may inhibit the engagement and 'flow' of the mixing process, and the subsequent screen management required to access the mixer across multiple windows can place high cognitive load on working memory and overload the limited capacity of the visual mechanism. This paper trials an eight-channel proto-type mixer which uses a novel approach to the mixer design to address these issues. The mixer uses an overview of the visual interface and employs multivariate data objects for channel parameters which can be filtered by the user. Our results suggest that this design, by reducing both the complexity of visual search and the amount of visual feedback on the screen at any one time, leads to improved results in terms of visual search, critical listening and mixing workflow.},

In this regard, the present work introduces an approach based on machine learning, and more precisely supervised classification, that aims at automatically inferring such policies for the case of piano music. The idea is to segment each pitch band of a frame-based pitch activation into single instances which are subsequently classified as active or non-active note events. Results using a comprehensive set of supervised classification strategies on the MAPS piano data-set report its competitiveness against other commonly considered strategies for note tracking as well as an improvement of more than 10\ in terms of F-measure when compared to the baseline considered for both frame-level and note-level evaluations.},

The amounts of delay tested in this study are relatively small in comparison to similar studies of auditory delays in a musical context (0ms, 10ms, 10ms±3ms, 20ms). We found that both groups rated the zero latency condition as higher quality for a series of quality measures in comparison to 10ms±3ms and 20ms latency, but did not show a significant difference in rating between 10ms latency and zero latency. Professional percussionists were more aware of the latency conditions and showed less variation of timing under the latency conditions, although this ability decreased as the temporal demands of the task increased. We compare our findings from each group and discuss them in relation to latency in interactive digital systems more generally and experimentally similar work on sensorimotor control and rhythmic performance.},

The state of the art in music source separation employs neural networks trained in a supervised fashion on multi-track databases to estimate the sources from a given mixture. With only few datasets available, often extensive data augmentation is used to combat overfitting. Mixing random tracks, however, can even reduce separation performance as instruments in real music are strongly correlated. The key concept in our approach is that source estimates of an optimal separator should be indistinguishable from real source signals. Based on this idea, we drive the separator towards outputs deemed as realistic by discriminator networks that are trained to tell apart real from separator samples. This way, we can also use unpaired source and mixture recordings without the drawbacks of creating unrealistic music mixtures. Our framework is widely applicable as it does not assume a specific network architecture or number of sources. To our knowledge, this is the first adoption of adversarial training for music source separation. In a prototype experiment for singing voice separation, separation performance increases with our approach compared to purely supervised training.},

detection difficult in the context of the ASVspoof 2017 corpus. We use FFT spectra, mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and inverted MFCC (IMFCC) frontends and investigate different backends based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). On this database, we find that IMFCC frontend based systems show smaller equal error rate (EER) for high quality replay attacks but higher EER for low quality replay attacks in comparison to the baseline. However, we find that it is not straightforward to understand the influence of an acoustic environment (AE), a playback device (PD) and a recording device (RD) of a replay spoofing attack. One reason is the unavailability of metadata for genuine recordings. Second, it is difficult to account for the effects of the factors: AE, PD and RD, and their interactions. Finally, our frame-level analysis shows that the presence of cues (recording artefacts) in the first few frames of genuine signals (missing from replayed ones) influence class prediction.},

The vulnerability of ASV systems to such attacks has been acknowledged and studied, but there has been no research into what spoofing detection systems are actually learning to discriminate. In this paper, we analyse the local behaviour of a replay spoofing detection system based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adapted from a state-of-the-art CNN (LCNN-FFT) submitted at the ASVspoof 2017 challenge. We generate temporal and spectral explanations for predictions of the model using the SLIME algorithm. Our findings suggest that in most instances of spoofing the model is using information in the first 400 milliseconds of each audio instance to make the class prediction. Knowledge of the characteristics that spoofing detection systems are exploiting can help build less vulnerable ASV systems, other spoofing detection systems, as well as better evaluation databases.},

Acoustic design of performance spaces typically places the performers' needs relatively low in the hierarchy of requirements in comparison to the quality of sound for an audience. While there are a number of studies relating to solo performers' and symphony orchestras' preferred acoustic environments, there is a paucity of literature on objective measurements of the impact of acoustic spaces on smaller ensembles. This study aims to bridge this gap by building a methodology for the analysis of changes in ensemble musical expression caused by different acoustic environments. The study finds that there is an association between reverberation time and global tempo for a colocated piano duo and provides a basis for future studies in this area. This work extends previous research in the area of acoustics and musical performance.},

The case-based reasoning part of the system relies on a measure of musical similarity based on the FANTASTIC and SynPy toolkits which provide melodic and syncopated rhythmic features, respectively. We conducted a listening test based on pair-wise comparison to assess to what extent the machine-based similarity models match human perception. We found the machine-based models to differ significantly to human responses due to differences in participants' responses. The best performing model relied on features from the FANTASTIC toolkit obtaining a rank match rate with human response of 63\, whilst features from the SynPy toolkit only obtained a ranking match rate of 46\. Whilst more work is needed on a stronger model of similarity, we do not believe these results prevent FANTASTIC features being used as a measure of similarity within creative systems.},

Its web-based platform enables collective "sound dialogues" that are open to everyone regardless of musical skills. Drawing on interactive participatory art and networked music performance, the system aims to provide engaging social experiences in colocated music-making situations. We collected data from four public performances including over 3,000 anonymous messages sent by audiences. We present the design of the system and then analyze the semantic content of messages using thematic and statistical analyses.

Many birds are most readily detected by their sounds, and thus, passive acoustic monitoring is highly appropriate. Yet acoustic monitoring is often held back by practical limitations such as the need for manual configuration, reliance on example sound libraries, low accuracy, low robustness, and limited ability to generalise to novel acoustic conditions. Here, we report outcomes from a collaborative data challenge. We present new acoustic monitoring datasets, summarise the machine learning techniques proposed by challenge teams, conduct detailed performance evaluation, and discuss how such approaches to detection can be integrated into remote monitoring projects. Multiple methods were able to attain performance of around 88\ area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), much higher performance than previous general-purpose methods. With modern machine learning, including deep learning, general-purpose acoustic bird detection can achieve very high retrieval rates in remote monitoring data, with no manual recalibration, and no pretraining of the detector for the target species or the acoustic conditions in the target environment.},

Automatic summarization is dominated by approaches which focus on the selection and concatenation of material in a text. What can be achieved by such approaches is intrinsically limited and far below what can be achieved by human summarizers. There is evidence that successfully creating a rich representation of text, including details of its narrative structure, would help to create more human-like summaries. This paper describes a part of our ongoing work on a cognitively inspired, creative approach to summarization. Here we detail our work on the detection of narrative structure in order to help build rich interpretations of a text and help give rise to a creative approach to summarization. In particular we consider the domain of Russian folktales. Using Vladimir Propp’s thorough description of the interrelations between the narrative elements of such tales, we pose this task as a constraint satisfaction problem. While we only consider this small domain, our approach can be applied to any domain of text on which enough constraints can be placed.},

An example of a fundamental aeroacoustic sound source is the Aeolian tone, generated by vortex shedding as air flows around an object. A compact source model of this sound is derived from fluid dynamics principles, operating in real-time and presenting highly relevant parameters to the user. A swinging sword, Aeolian harp and propeller are behaviour models presented to illustrate how a taxonomy of real-time aeroacoustic sound synthesis can be achieved through physical modelling.

practice it is difficult to collect enough samples for most classes of

transcription into multiple intermediate tasks in order to improve the training

  abstract          = {© 2018 IEEE. Existing music recordings are often rearranged, for example to fit their duration and structure to video content. Often an expert is needed to find suitable cut points allowing for imperceptible transitions between different sections. In previous work, the search for these cuts is restricted to the beginnings of beats or measures and only timbre and loudness are taken into account, while melodic expectations and instrument continuity are neglected. We instead aim to learn these features by training neural networks on a dataset of over 300 popular Western songs to classify which note onsets are suitable entry or exit points for a cut. We investigate existing and novel architectures and different feature representations, and find that best performance is achieved using neural networks with two-dimensional convolutions applied to spectrogram input covering several seconds of audio with a high temporal resolution of 23 or 46 ms. Finally, we analyse our best model using saliency maps and find it attends to rhythmical structures and the presence of sounds at the onset position, suggesting instrument activity to be important for predicting cut quality.},

KAM separates a given source by applying robust statistics on the selection of time-frequency bins obtained through a source-specific kernel, typically the k-NN function. Even though the parameter k appears to be key for a successful separation, little discussion on its influence or optimisation can be found in the literature. Here we propose a novel method, based on graph theory statistics, to automatically optimise k in a vocal separation task. We introduce the k-NN hubness as an indicator to find a tailored k at a low computational cost. Subsequently, we evaluate our method in comparison to the common approach to choose k. We further discuss the influence and importance of this parameter with illuminating results.},

This special issue argues for the opposite view: Miscommunication is a highly structured and ubiquitous feature of human interaction that systematically underpins people's ability to create and maintain shared languages. Contributions from conversation analysis, computational linguistics, experimental psychology, and formal semantics provide evidence for these claims. They highlight the multi-modal, multi-person character of miscommunication. They demonstrate the incremental, contingent, and locally adaptive nature of the processes people use to detect and deal with miscommunication. They show how these processes can drive language change. In doing so, these contributions introduce an alternative perspective on what successful communication is, new methods for studying it, and application areas where these ideas have a particular impact. We conclude that miscommunication is not noise but essential to the productive flexibility of human communication, especially our ability to respond constructively to new people and new situations.},

Neverthe-less, these procedures require a prior knowledge of the type offilters to be modeled. In addition, fixed filter bank architecturesare required in automatic mixing contexts. Based on end-to-endconvolutional neural networks, we introduce a general purpose ar-chitecture for equalization matching. Thus, by using an end-to-end learning approach, the model approximates the equalizationtarget as a content-based transformation without directly findingthe transfer function. The network learns how to process the au-dio directly in order to match the equalized target audio. We trainthe network through unsupervised and supervised learning proce-dures. We analyze what the model is actually learning and howthe given task is accomplished.

We report on the kinds of collaboration and value that emerged through the co-creation of an interactive drama, and how a traditional Chinese literature composition method was used to structure the design process. We present a notation for describing cross-cultural co-creation and reflect on the careful balance that we found needed to be struck between the depth of co-creation, immersion in local culture, cultural exchange and interactivity.

An intelligent control tool that allows using sound examples to control effects would strongly benefit these users. In a previous work we proposed a control method for the dynamic range compressor (DRC) using a random forest regression model. It maps audio features extracted from a reference sound to DRC parameter values, such that the processed signal resembles the reference. The key to good performance in this system is the relevance and effectiveness of audio features. This paper focusses on a thorough exposition and assessment of the features, as well as the comparison of different strategies to find the optimal feature set for DRC parameter estimation, using automatic feature selection methods. This enables us to draw conclusions about which features are relevant to core DRC parameters. Our results show that conventional time and frequency domain features well known from the literature are sufficient to estimate the DRC’s threshold and ratio parameters, while more specialized features are needed for attack and release time, which induce more subtle changes to the signal.},

  abstract  = {The digitization of art collections is a great opportunity to engage audiences beyond the context of the museum visit. Interfaces to access collections have been initially tailored for professional search tasks: the new challenge is how to design systems for open, casual, and leisure-based explorations. In a human-centered framework, the users’ perspective is a fundamental step to design and improve creative solutions. How can we listen to and understand the potential users, in order to design meaningful experiences? How can we collect insights, and what do these tell us about the users and the systems? We explore the use of inquiry techniques as a method to surface the curiosities people have for paintings. During two iterations, visitors of public events wrote questions they had about selected paintings. 138 Post-its were collected and thematically analyzed. Results highlight that curiosities are contextualized, and that artworks are interpreted mainly as scenes. People are interested in meanings and symbols; they also displayed the use of fantasy and empathy. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of age, previous knowledge of the painting, and frequency of visiting museums on the questions’ content through statistical analysis. While no strong finding emerged, we noticed that adults and kids likewise display an active role in the inquiry process, and that a previous knowledge of the painting is connected to more descriptive and atomic curiosities. In the discussion, we suggest design opportunities might lay in the interactive discovery of information, in storytelling-based descriptions, and in emotional connection. Our findings suggest that in leisure-based explorations atomic information might not be satisfying, and that descriptions should be contextualized to the painting. Our presentation will be an opportunity to discuss the value of the method, and to comment on how the insights could be embedded into the design of leisure-based experiences.},

Our study addresses the topic by using data collection method of “think aloud” and data analysis method of “protocol analysis” along with the unconstrained concept generation environment. Collected data from the participants without service design experience were analyzed by open and selective coding. Through the research, we found correlations between physical activity and divergent thinking, and also identified physical behaviors that predict a designer’s transition to divergent thinking. We conclude that there are significant relations between designers’ design thinking and the behavioral features of their body and face.

Different classes of onsets can be found in musical signals, determined as being hard, or soft, by the initial energy transfer. Most onset detectors are general purpose and attempt to detect both classes of onsets, although some specifically attempt to detect soft onsets. Temporal reassignment operators related to group delay have previously been employed in onset detectors for the purposes of soft onset detection and pruning of time-frequency elements deemed to consist of vibrato. We consider the use of temporal reassignment for the detection of hard onsets and also employ the second mixed derivative of phase as a means to prune the spectral energy. Experimental validation of the proposed approach is given, showing improvements relative to state-of-the-art general purpose onset detectors for the specific tasks.},

This position paper introduces the concept of complexity management in instrument design as a means to optimize the learning rewards cycle in an effort to maintain player motivation. Successful fluency and expertise on an instrument requires sustained practice. In the quest to enable exceptional levels of expression, instruments designed for virtuosic performance often have a high level of complexity, which can be overwhelming for a beginner, decreasing practice motivation. Here we explain complexity management, the idea of intentionally limiting instrument complexity on a temporary basis so that instrument difficulty is optimally matched to user skill and users always remain capable of focused learning and enjoy sufficient musical success to motivate continued practice. We discuss the relevance of Csikszentmihalyi's ideas about flow, along with concepts from traditional music learning, such as chunking and internalization, along with the importance of practice and enjoyment. We then propose our own concept of learning efficiency and the importance of controlling challenge. Finally, we introduce our own experiments into complexity management using the violin, an existing example of an instrument with high input complexity. We discuss the effects of simplifying intonation in order to make early musical success easier along with plans for further investigations.},

The Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) is an emerging research field positioned at the intersection of Internet of Things, new interfaces for musical expression, ubiquitous music, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and participatory art. From a computer science perspective, IoMusT refers to the networks of computing devices embedded in physical objects (musical things) dedicated to the production and/or reception of musical content. Musical things, such as smart musical instruments or wearables, are connected by an infrastructure that enables multidirectional communication, both locally and remotely. We present a vision in which the IoMusT enables the connection of digital and physical domains by means of appropriate information and communication technologies, fostering novel musical applications and services. The ecosystems associated with the IoMusT include interoperable devices and services that connect musicians and audiences to support musician-musician, audience-musicians, and audience-audience interactions. In this paper, we first propose a vision for the IoMusT and its motivations. We then discuss five scenarios illustrating how the IoMusT could support: 1) augmented and immersive concert experiences; 2) audience participation; 3) remote rehearsals; 4) music e-learning; and 5) smart studio production. We identify key capabilities missing from today's systems and discuss the research needed to develop these capabilities across a set of interdisciplinary challenges. These encompass network communication (e.g., ultra-low latency and security), music information research (e.g., artificial intelligence for real-time audio content description and multimodal sensing), music interaction (e.g., distributed performance and music e-learning), as well as legal and responsible innovation aspects to ensure that future IoMusT services are socially desirable and undertaken in the public interest.},

Several interfaces have been designed to mitigate biases and to standardise procedures, enabling indirect comparisons.

Typically, it is possible to navigate and play their content through search interfaces based on metadata and file-wide tags. However, because this music is largely unknown, additional methods of discovery need to be explored. In this paper, we focus on a use case for music learners. We present a web app prototype that allows novice and expert musicians to discover songs in Jamendo's music collection by specifying a set of chords. Its purpose is to provide a more pleasurable practice experience by suggesting novel songs to play along with, instead of practising isolated chords or with the same song over and over again. To handle less chord-oriented songs and transcription errors that inevitably arise from the automatic chord estimation used to populate the database, query results are ranked according to a computational confidence measure. In order to assess the validity of the confidence ranked system, we conducted a small pilot user study to assess its usefulness. Drawing on those preliminary findings, we identify some design recommendations for future applications of music learning and music search engines focusing on the user experience when interacting with sound.},

We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds.

  abstract          = {Copyright © 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. The effectiveness of medical treatment depends on the quality of the patient–clinician relationship. It has been proposed that this depends on the extent to which the patient and clinician build a shared understanding of illness and treatment. Here, we use the tools of conversation analysis (CA) to explore this idea in the context of psychiatric consultations. The CA “repair” framework provides an analysis of the processes people use to deal with problems in speaking, hearing, and understanding. These problems are especially critical in the treatment of psychosis where patients and health care professionals need to communicate about the disputed meaning of hallucinations and delusion. Patients do not feel understood, they are frequently non-adherent with treatment, and many have poor outcomes. We present an overview of two studies focusing on the role of repair as a mechanism for producing and clarifying meaning in psychiatrist–patient communication and its association with treatment outcomes. The first study shows patient clarification or repair of psychiatrists’ talk is associated with better patient adherence to treatment. The second study shows that training which emphasizes the importance of building an understanding of patients’ psychotic experiences increases psychiatrists’ self-repair. We propose that psychiatrists are working harder to make their talk understandable and acceptable to the patient by taking the patient's perspective into account. We conclude that these findings provide evidence that repair is an important mechanism for building shared understanding in doctor–patient communication and contributes to better therapeutic relationships and treatment adherence. The conversation analytic account of repair is currently the most sophisticated empirical model for analyzing how people construct shared meaning and understanding. Repair appears to reflect greater commitment to and engagement in communication and improve both the quality and outcomes of communication. Reducing potential miscommunication between psychiatrists and their patients with psychosis is a low-cost means of enhancing treatment from both the psychiatrist and patient perspective. Given that misunderstanding and miscommunication are particularly problematic in psychosis, this is critical for improving the longer term outcomes of treatment for these patients who often have poor relationships with psychiatrists and health care services more widely.},

The understanding of musical syntax is a topic of fundamental importance for systematic musicology and lies at the core intersection of music theory and analysis, music psychology, and computational modeling. This chapter discusses the notion of musical syntax and its potential foundations based on notions such as sequence grammaticality, expressive unboundedness, generative capacity, sequence compression and stability. Subsequently, it discusses problems concerning the choice of musical building blocks to be modeled as well as the underlying principles of sequential structure building. The remainder of the chapter reviews the main theoretical proposals that can be characterized under different mechanisms of structure building, in particular approaches using finite-context or finite-state models as well as tree-based models of context-free complexity (including the Generative Theory of Tonal Music) and beyond. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the main issues and questions driving current research and a preparation for the subsequent empirical chapter Musical Syntax II.},

  abstract          = {© 2018, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Efforts to develop a formal characterization of musical structure are often framed in syntactic terms, sometimes but not always with direct inspiration from research on language. In Chap. 25, we present syntactic approaches to characterizing musical structure and survey a range of theoretical issues involved in developing formal syntactic theories of sequential structure in music. Such theories are often computational in nature, lending themselves to implementation and our first goal here is to review empirical research on computational modeling of musical structure from a syntactic point of view. We ask about the motivations for implementing a model and assess the range of approaches that have been taken to date. It is important to note that while a computational model may be capable of deriving an optimal structural description of a piece of music, human cognitive processing may not achieve this optimal performance, or may even process syntax in a different way. Therefore we emphasize the difference between developing an optimal model of syntactic processing and developing a model that simulates human syntactic processing. Furthermore, we argue that, while optimal models (e. g., optimal compression or prediction) can be useful as a benchmark or yardstick for assessing human performance, if we wish to understand human cognition then simulating human performance (including aspects that are nonoptimal or even erroneous) should be the priority. Following this principle, we survey research on processing of musical syntax from the perspective of computational modeling, experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. There exists a large number of computational models of musical syntax, but we limit ourselves to those that are explicitly cognitively motivated, assessing them in the context of theoretical, psychological and neuroscientific research.},

However, designing novel musical interfaces for non-musicians can be challenging because they lack conceptual and technical musical skills. In this paper we explore the effects of task motivation (experiential goal vs utilitarian goal) and user interface mode (whether the content is editable, and whether content can be replayed), on non-musicians’ creative engagement with novel musical interfaces. We show through an empirical study of twenty-four participants that an experiential exploratory goal encourages users’ creative engagement compared to a utilitarian creative goal. We found that being able to replay records is less important when participants have an experiential exploratory goal than when they have a utilitarian creative goal. Results also indicate that allowing people to replay their musical ideas increased some aspects of their creative engagement which was further increased when they were able to edit their creations. We also found that creative engagement increased when the interface supported users in planning ahead. A descriptive model of non-musician's creative engagement with musical interfaces is proposed including three modes of musicking. An optimal trajectory of creative engagement through these modes is suggested and a description of inferred motivations, output, status and activities during creative processes is discussed. Design implications are proposed for supporting novices’ creative engagement taking into consideration their motivation and skills, and supporting insight and real-time activity.},

Bipartite graph filtering of the Linked Data cloud, content-based music information retrieval, machine learning on crowd-sourced information and Semantic Web technologies are combined to analyze existing and create new categories of music artists through which they are connected. The categories can uncover similarities between artists who otherwise may not be immediately associated: for example, they may share ethnic background or nationality, common musical style or be signed to the same record label, come from the same geographic origin, share a fate or an affliction, or have made similar lifestyle choices. They may also prefer similar musical keys, instrumentation, rhythmic attributes, or even moods their music evokes. This demonstration is primarily meant to showcase the graph-based artist discovery interface of MusicLynx: how artists are connected through various categories, how the different graph filtering methods affect the topology and geometry of linked artists graphs, and ways in which users can connect to external services for additional content and information about objects of their interest.},

Evaluation using eight different sound class stimuli and 66 different samples was undertaken. The additive synthesizer is the only synthesis method not considered significantly different from the reference sample across all sounds classes.

This promotes the acquisition of residual components associated to the weak co-excitation of damped notes due to the legato pedalling technique. Features that represent the sympathetic resonance measure were extracted from residuals. We finally used a logistic regression classifier to distinguish the existence of legato-pedal onsets.},

Tools such as "wavesurfer.js", "waveform-playlist" and "trackswitch.js" provide highly-configurable players, allowing a more interactive exploration of scientific results that goes beyond simple linear playback.
However, the audio output to be presented is in many cases not generated by the same web technologies. The process of preparing audio data for display therefore requires manual intervention, in order to bridge the resulting gap between programming languages. While this is acceptable for one-time events, such as the preparation of final results, it prevents the usage of such players during the iterative development cycle. Having access to rich audio players already during development would allow researchers to get more instantaneous feedback. The current workflow consists of repeatedly importing audio into a digital audio workstation in order to achieve similar capabilities, a repetitive and time-consuming process.
In order to address these needs, we present "pywebaudioplayer", a Python package that automates the generation of code snippets for the each of the three aforementioned web audio players. It is aimed at use-cases where audio development in Python is combined with web visualisation. Notable examples are "Jupyter Notebook" and WSGI-compatible web frameworks such as "Flask" or "Django".},

Smartmusical instruments are a class of IoT devices formusicmaking, which encompass embedded intelligence as well as wireless connectivity. In previous work, we established design requirements for a novel smart musical instrument, a smart cajón, following a user-centered approach. This paper describes the implementation and technical evaluation of the designed component of the smart cajón related to hit classification and repurposing. A conventional acoustic cajón was enhanced with sensors to classify position of the hit and the gesture that produced it. The instrument was equipped with five piezo pickups attached to the internal panels and a condenser microphone located inside. The developed sound engine leveraged digital signal processing, sensor fusion, and machine learning techniques to classify the position, dynamics, and timbre of each hit. The techniques were devised and implemented to achieve low latency between action and the electronically-generated sounds, as well as keep computational efficiency high. The system was tuned to classify two main cajón playing techniques at different locations and we conducted evaluations using over 2,000 hits performed by two professional players. We first assessed the classification performance when training and testing data related to recordings fromthe same player. In this configuration, classification accuracies of 100\ were obtained for hit detection and location. Accuracies of over 90\ were obtained when classifying timbres produced by the two playing techniques. We then assessed the classifier in a cross-player configuration (training and testing were performed using recordings from different players). Results indicated that while hit location scales relatively well across different players, gesture identification requires that the involved classifiers are trained specifically for each musician.},

While there is some evidence for this phenomenon in the visual and, to a lesser extent, the auditory modality, little is known about whether it operates in the complex auditory contexts of daily life. Here, we examined how prediction error responses behave in a more complex and ecologically valid auditory context than those typically studied. We created musical tone sequences with different degrees of pitch uncertainty to manipulate the precision of participants’ auditory expectations. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure the magnetic counterpart of the mismatch negativity (MMNm) as a neural marker of prediction error in a multi-feature paradigm. Pitch, slide, intensity and timbre deviants were included. We compared high-entropy stimuli, consisting of a set of non-repetitive melodies, with low-entropy stimuli consisting of a simple, repetitive pitch pattern. Pitch entropy was quantitatively assessed with an information-theoretic model of auditory expectation. We found a reduction in pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-entropy as compared to the low-entropy context. No significant differences were found for intensity and timbre MMNm amplitudes. Furthermore, in a separate behavioral experiment investigating the detection of pitch deviants, similar decreases were found for accuracy measures in response to more fine-grained increases in pitch entropy. Our results are consistent with a precision modulation of auditory prediction error in a musical context, and suggest that this effect is specific to features that depend on the manipulated dimension—pitch information, in this case.

Whilst the focus of attention in an instrumental music lesson is refinement of the student’s musical performance, conversation plays an essential role; not just as a way to analyse the student’s musical contributions, but to organise them within the lesson flow. Participants may respond to talk through performance and vice versa, or even spend periods of time exchanging purely musical contributions. The short musical fragments exchanged by the participants are managed within lesson dialogue in ways analogous to conversational turn-taking. Problems in the student’s performance are refined through both student self-initiated and tutor other-initiated repair, initiated by embodied action and play. A fundamental part of turn-taking is managing the transition to a new speaker. The presence of musical contributions allows for additional types of transition, for example from a turn at talk, to a musical contribution. In conversation, there is generally a preference for a short pause at the transition to a new speaker, and overlap tends to be minimised when it occurs. Through detailed qualitative video analysis of a one-to-one clarinet lesson, we find differences in the preferences regarding overlap when purely musical contributions are being exchanged, and that the duration of overlap during these exchanges of fragments of music are significant.},

Disfluency, defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to gen- erate better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if dis- fluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six phys- ically identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened disflu- ency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualita- tive data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.},

How do signals of understanding and misunderstanding affect the coordination of language use in conversation? Using a chat tool and a maze-based reference task, we test two experimental manipulations that selectively interfere with feedback in live conversation: (a) "Attenuation" that replaces positive signals of understanding such as "right" or "okay" with weaker, more provisional signals such as "errr" or "umm" and (2) "Amplification" that replaces relatively specific signals of misunderstanding from clarification requests such as "on the left?" with generic signals of trouble such as "huh?" or "eh?". The results show that Amplification promotes rapid convergence on more systematic, abstract ways of describing maze locations while Attenuation has no significant effect. We interpret this as evidence that "running repairs"-the processes of dealing with misunderstandings on the fly-are key drivers of semantic coordination in dialogue. This suggests a new direction for experimental work on conversation and a productive way to connect the empirical accounts of Conversation Analysis with the representational and processing concerns of Formal Semantics and Psycholinguistics.},

While most state-of-the-art approaches are supervised methods trained on large datasets, interest in non-data-driven approaches such as Kernel Additive Modelling (KAM) remains high due to their interpretability and adaptability. KAM performs the separation of a given source applying robust statistics on the time-frequency bins selected by a source-specific kernel function, commonly the K-NN function. This choice assumes that the source of interest repeats in both time and frequency. In practice, this assumption does not always hold. Therefore, we introduce a shift-invariant kernel function capable of identifying similar spectral content even under frequency shifts. This way, we can considerably increase the amount of suitable sound material available to the robust statistics. While this leads to an increase in separation performance, a basic formulation, however, is computationally expensive. Therefore, we additionally present acceleration techniques that lower the overall computational complexity.},

Meanwhile, deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art results for matching vocal imitations to imitated sounds, yet little is known about how well learned features represent the perceptual similarity between vocalisations and queried sounds. In this paper, we address this question using similarity ratings between vocal imitations and imitated drum sounds. We use a linear mixed effect regression model to show how features learned by convolutional auto-encoders (CAEs) perform as predictors for perceptual similarity between sounds. Our experiments show that CAEs outperform three baseline feature sets (spectrogram-based representations, MFCCs, and temporal features) at predicting the subjective similarity ratings. We also investigate how the size and shape of the encoded layer effects the predictive power of the learned features. The results show that preservation of temporal information is more important than spectral resolution for this application.},

Here we introduce a novel alternative approach exploiting a new modality: posture classification using bespoke'smart' trousers with integrated textile pressure sensors. Changes in posture translate to changes in pressure patterns across the surface of our clothing. We describe the construction of the textile pressure sensor that can detect these changes. Using simple machine learning techniques on data gathered from 6 participants we demonstrate its ability to discriminate between 19 different basic posture types with high accuracy.

In particular, we study the use of features from different levels of deep belief network for quantizing the audio data into vectors of audio word counts. These vectors represent the audio scripts of different lengths that make them easier to train a classifier. We show in the experiment that the audio word count vectors generated from mixture of DBN features at different layers give better performance than the MFCC features.

Using a trained network, we compute label vector similarities which is compared to groundtruth similarity. The results highlight several important aspects of music tagging and neural networks. We show that networks can be effective despite relatively large error rates in groundtruth datasets, while conjecturing that label noise can be the cause of varying tag-wise performance differences. Lastly, the analysis of our trained network provides valuable insight into the relationships between music tags.

The timing settings are particularly important for controlling the manner in which they will shape an audio signal. We present a subjective user study of DRC, where a series of different compressor attack and release setting are varied and applied to a set of 30 sec audio tracks. Participants are then asked to rate which ballistic settings are most appropriate for the style of music in their judgement and asked to select one of a series of tag words, to describe the style or setting of the song. Results show that the attack parameter influences perceived style, more than the release parameter. From the study this is seen more evidently in the case of Jazz and Rock styles than in EDM or Hip-Hop. The area of intelligent Music production systems might benefit from this study in the future as it may help to inform appropriateness for certain DRC settings in varying styles.},

  abstract   = {This thesis is about DMI (digital musical instrument) performance, its audiences, and their perception of error.
The goal of this research is to improve current understanding of how audiences perceive DMI performance, where performers and their audiences often have no shared, external frame of reference with which to judge the musical output. Further complicating this audience-performer relationship are human-computer interaction (HCI) issues arising from the use of a com- puter as a musical instrument. In current DMI literature, there is little direct inquiry of audience perception on these issues.
Error is an aspect of this kind of audience perception. Error, a condition reached by stepping out of bounds, appears at first to be a simple binary quantity, but the location and nature of those boundaries change with con- text. With deviation the locus of style and artistic progress, understanding how audiences perceive error has the potential to lend important insight to the cultural mechanics of DMI performance.
In this thesis I describe the process of investigating audience perception and unpacking these issues through three studies. Each study examines the relative effects of various factors on audience perception — instrument familiarity and musical style, gesture size, and visible risk — using a novel methodology combining real-time data collected by mobile phone, and post- hoc data in the form of written surveys. The results have implications for DMI and HCI researchers as well as DMI performers and composers, and contribute insights on these confounding factors from the audience’s perspective as well as important insights on audience perception of error in this context. Further, through this thesis I contribute a practical method and tool that can be used to continue this audience-focused work in the future.},

We present a polyphonic transcription method that converts a music audio signal into a human-readable musical score, by integrating multi-pitch detection and rhythm quantization methods. This integration is made difficult by the fact that the multi-pitch detection produces erroneous notes such as extra notes and introduces timing errors that are added to temporal deviations due to musical expression. Thus, we propose a rhythm quantization method that can remove extra notes by extending the metrical hidden Markov model and optimize the model parameters. We also improve the note-tracking process of multi-pitch detection by refining the treatment of repeated notes and adjustment of onset times. Finally, we propose evaluation measures for transcribed scores. Systematic evaluations on commonly used classical piano data show that these treatments improve the performance of transcription, which can be used as benchmarks for further studies.},

A rule-based segmentation process extracts glissando candidates that are consecutive note changes in the same direction. Glissandi are then identified by two HMMs (glissando and non-glissando). The study uses a newly created dataset of Chinese bamboo flute recordings. The results, based on both frame- and segment-based evaluation, achieve F-measures of 78\ and 73\ for ascending glissandi, and 65\ and 72\ for descending glissandi, respectively. The dataset and method can be used for performance analysis.},

In jazz improvisation, patterns are of particular interest for the analysis of improvisation styles, the oral transmission of musical language, the practice of improvisation, and the psychology of creative processes. The ongoing project “Dig That Lick” is devoted to addressing these questions with the help of a large database of jazz solo transcriptions generated by automated melody extraction algorithms. To expose these transcriptions to jazz researchers, two prototypes of user interfaces were designed that work currently with the 456 manually transcribed jazz solos of the Weimar Jazz Database. The first one is a Shiny application that allows exploring a set of 653 of the most common patterns by eminent players. The second one is a web interface for a general two-staged pattern search in the Weimar Jazz Database featuring regular expressions. These applications aim on the one hand at an expert audience of jazz researchers to facilitate generating and testing hypotheses about patterns in jazz improvisation, and on the other hand at a wider audience of jazz teachers, students, and fans.},

Methods for interpreting machine learning models can help one understand their global and/or local behaviours, and thereby improve them. In this work, we apply a global analysis method to a machine listening model, which essentially inverts the features generated in a model back into an interpretable form like a sonogram. We demonstrate this method for a state-of-the-art singing voice detection model. We train up-convolutional neural networks to invert the feature generated at each layer of the model. The results suggest that the deepest fully connected layer of the model does not preserve temporal and harmonic structures, but that the inverted features from the deepest convolutional layer do. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of a large number of inputs suggests that the deepest layer in the model learns a decision function as the information it preserves depends on the class label associated with an input.},

The mechanism resulted in clear preference for a single HRTF set in a majority of cases.

This approach is shown to be equally effective for both novice and expert listeners in selecting their preferred HRTF set.},

Hardware is becoming smaller, less visible, more connected and the collected data more seamless and ubiquitous.

First, to introduce new audiences to the Minimalist genre through interaction with the piece presented as an engaging game. Second, to use large-scale data collection within the app to address research questions about the factors determining rhythm production performance. The twelve patterns can be differentiated using existing theories of rhythmic complexity. Using performance indicators from the game such as tap accuracy we can determine which patterns players found most challenging and so assess hypotheses from theoretical models with empirical evidence. The app has been downloaded over 140,000 times since the launch in July 2015, and over 46 million rows of gameplay data have been collected, requiring a big data approach to analysis. The results shed light on the rhythmic factors contributing to performance difficulty and show that the effect of making a transition from one pattern to the next is as significant, in terms of pattern difficulty, as the inherent complexity of the pattern itself. Challenges that arose in applying this novel approach are discussed.},

Researchers have proposed methods to explain neural network predictions by building explanations either in terms of input components (e.g., pixels in an image) or in terms of input regions (e.g., the area containing the face of a Labrador). Such methods aim to determine the trustworthiness of a model, as well as to guide its improvement. In this paper, we argue that explanations in terms of input regions are useful for analysing machine listening systems. We introduce a novel method based on feature inversion to identify a region in an input time-frequency representation that is most influential to a prediction. We demonstrate it for a state-of-the-art singing voice detection model. We evaluate the quality of the generated explanations on two public benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that the presented method often identifies a region of an input instance that has a decisive effect on the classification.},
